This is how I run liftOver on bed files. 

The script lives on wynton here: 
/wynton/group/ahituv/bin/liftover_bed-wynton.py

To run, this script takes three inputs:  
a bed file of genome coordinates 
name of the original genome build 
name of genome build you want to transfer your coordinates to. 

for example, if I wanted to liftover a file from hg38 to hs1 (T2T)  I would run the command:
python /wynton/group/ahituv/bin/liftover_bed-wynton.py <<mydata.bed>> hg38 hs1

This should work for most common species (e.g. mm9, rhemac10), but if your species isn't here, message me and we can setup the liftover and  chain file for your species.
